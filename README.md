# Abstract
>_Understanding what attributes people look for in a partner could be useful in helping match singles either by connecting them on their traits, or providing better information to those hoping to improve their odds. In this regard, gender differences seem to be a worthwhile topic to study in detail because males and females are likely to perceive attributes differently. Other than gender, variables such as income level, educational background, professional background, ethnicity, etc. potentially have influence on decisions by people who are seeking a match. However, personality traits are expected to also have an undeniable impact on demeanor. Thus, in order to study a wide range of contributing factors in dating preferences, we have chosen an experimental data set obtained from waves of “speed dating” events. Experimental data based on real social interactions will likely yield more insight than secondary data obtained from dating apps/websites. Through data analysis utilizing SAS, we are able to study different distributions, correlations, and associations to gain insights into the behaviors and preferences that drive partner selection and dating._

# Data

The dataset used for this study was obtained from a study performed at Columbia University during a speed dating events from 2002-2004 (http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/) and is shared publicly. The attendees in this experiment had a four-minute “first date” with every other participant of the opposite sex, and at the end, they were asked whether they would like to have a second date with the same person or not.   
The data is composed of 8,378 observations and 195 variables, with 277 male and 274 female participants during 21 rounds of the experiment. In general, variables can be divided in two categories:
- Demographic variables of participants, including age, race, religion, gender, educational field, career, income, and activities of interest.
- Preferences towards personality attributes, including attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests.

Measures of preferences at all dimensions were reported through two questionnaires: one to survey participants on their views of potential partners, and the other whereby they can evaluate those who participated in “dates” with.  Questions they answered include: what an individual looks for in the opposite sex; what most of an individual’s fellow men/women look for in the opposite sex; what an opposite sex looks for, and how a person rates himself or herself. All values were recorded on percentage or 10-point scale and across three phases: one pre-event and two follow-up surveys (3-4 weeks after dating event), which is the main reason of existence of comparatively large number of variables in the study.  
For the purpose of our analysis, we restrict the measures of preferences to only the ones recorded at the day of the event, as the next two repeated measures seem to be primarily for reliability considerations in the experiment, which is beyond the objectives of this paper. However, we will incorporate almost all data from the demographic attributes.
